            <li>Here is how I look like in real life.

                I tend not to post photo online, but I realized that I need to make at least one professional photo that looks casual enough.
                I might take the photo in the future, but please bear with this for now.

                What sparks my interest was generally that I spend my work in front of my laptop, and I got curious with programming although I only learn it casually.
                After talking with my friends who has more experience with programming, I decided to pursue new career path in software engineering.
                There is no concrete plan on what kind of technology I will master, as the basics are quite broad. However, I think I can fit with this as I find programming to be really interesting.
                Especially now that I learned things here with RevoU, my chances are getting bigger and I learned a lot.

                I am majoring in food technology back in my university, spending most of my years in laboratory.
                I found similarities where I have to work carefully now, with differences that instead of glassware and machines, now it's codes. And punctuation marks.

                I like playing PC games, and put lots of hours within it. I play competitive games mostly (DOTA 2, Overwatch 2), and sometimes RTS games like Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Starcraft. I also play Genshin Impact, but for totally different reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                I enjoy sports, but its only either jogging or badminton. I watch other ones too but these two are what I mainly do for sport.
